summary: Taproot introduced Schnorr signatures and Tapscript paths, improving efficiency, privacy characteristics, and multisig flexibility.
story: >-
  Bob’s company runs a treasury wallet with complex signing policies. Before Taproot, many
  cooperative spends revealed more structure than needed on-chain and consumed extra weight.
  Taproot changed the default experience: cooperative key-path spends can look simple, while
  script-path options stay available when needed. That means better efficiency and improved
  privacy characteristics in common cases, not invisibility. Bob learns Taproot is a careful
  soft-fork extension, not a rewrite of Bitcoin’s trust model. The same conservative activation
  philosophy applies: broad review, explicit semantics, and compatibility.
keyTakeaways:
  - Taproot added Schnorr and Tapscript capabilities via soft fork.
  - Cooperative spend paths can be more efficient and less revealing.
  - Taproot builds on, not replaces, Bitcoin’s base security model.
securityNotes:
  - Incorrect script-path assumptions can still create wallet implementation errors.
  - Privacy benefits are contextual and depend on usage patterns.

policyVsConsensus:
  consensusRules:
    - Schnorr and tapscript validation rules are consensus-enforced post-activation.
    - Taproot output semantics must satisfy active script constraints.
  policyRules:
    - Wallet defaults decide when Taproot outputs are used.
    - Relay policy may influence early adoption behavior.
  explanation: Taproot semantics are consensus; deployment pace and default usage are policy/product choices.

    whatHappened: Taproot activated through coordinated soft-fork deployment.
    whyItMatters: It expanded signature/script capability while preserving conservative upgrade norms.

## Deep Dive
Taproot combines Schnorr key aggregation semantics and tapscript execution paths under consensus rules activated in 2021.

**Real Data:** Show `Taproot adoption percentage` and `average fee pressure`. This reveals when efficiency/privacy improvements are actually used in production.

## Walkthrough
1. Create Taproot output (key-path dominant).
2. Spend cooperatively via key-path when possible.
3. Use script-path only when policy conditions require fallback.

## Common Misconceptions
- “Taproot makes transactions anonymous.” It does not.
- “Taproot removed script complexity.” It reorganized how it appears on-chain.
- “Taproot is a hard fork.” It was a soft fork.

## Check Yourself (Questions)
- Which BIPs define Taproot and Tapscript?
- Why does key-path spending matter operationally?
- What metric indicates real-world Taproot usage?
