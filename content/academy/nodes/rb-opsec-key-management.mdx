summary: Bitcoin self-custody security depends on operational discipline: key isolation, backups, threat modeling, and recovery practice.
story: >-
  Carol helps a family office move from exchange custody to self-custody. Everyone focuses on hardware wallet brand
  debates, but she starts elsewhere: threat model, who can coerce whom, what happens during travel, and how recovery
  works if a signer disappears. They run tabletop exercises and discover weak points: seed phrases photographed on phones,
  no tested backup restoration, and single-person approval bottlenecks. Over weeks, they redesign: geographically separate
  backups, role separation, spending limits, and emergency playbooks. The result is less "heroic security" and more boring,
  repeatable procedure. In Bitcoin, boring is good. Protocol security can be world-class, yet funds can still be lost by
  weak operations. OPSEC is where theory meets reality.
keyTakeaways:
  - Key management failures are often operational, not protocol-level.
  - Backups must be tested with real restore drills.
  - Security posture should match value-at-risk and adversary capability.
securityNotes:
  - Social engineering and endpoint compromise are common practical threats.
  - Multisig, hardware isolation, and process controls reduce single-point failure risk.

policyVsConsensus:
  consensusRules:
    - Consensus validates signatures and script conditions regardless of organizational process.
    - Lost keys are unrecoverable without valid spending credentials.
  policyRules:
    - Organizations define approval thresholds, signer roles, and withdrawal procedures.
    - Incident response, monitoring, and key rotation are operational policy decisions.
  explanation: Consensus cannot rescue poor key operations; policy and process determine real-world loss prevention.

## Deep Dive
Operational security combines key-generation hygiene, signing isolation, backup integrity, monitoring, and incident response. Good OPSEC treats key compromise as a process risk that must be continuously managed.

### Real Data
Show `confirmation depth`, `fee volatility`, and `transaction anomaly alerts` for managed wallets. These metrics inform real-time spending controls and fraud response.

## Walkthrough
1. Define threat model and custody requirements.
2. Implement signer roles and hardware isolation.
3. Create encrypted, geographically separated backups.
4. Test restore and emergency procedures periodically.
5. Review logs and rotate processes after incidents.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Hardware wallet alone solves security." Process still matters.
- "Seed phrase backup once is enough forever." Restore drills are essential.
- "Protocol security prevents user loss." Operational mistakes can still be fatal.

## Check Yourself (Questions)
- What is the difference between protocol risk and custody process risk?
- Why should backup testing be scheduled, not ad hoc?
- Which controls reduce single-operator compromise impact?
