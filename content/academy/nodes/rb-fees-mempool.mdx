summary: The fee market prioritizes scarce block space; mempools hold valid pending transactions under local relay policy.
story: >-
  A small merchant receives two payments at once. One confirms in minutes; the other sits
  for hours. Same amount, different fee rates. She learns that Bitcoin does not price by
  transferred value but by transaction weight and market congestion. Mempools are waiting
  rooms, and each node’s room differs slightly based on policy and timing. When demand rises,
  low-fee transactions get pushed down the queue unless users bump fees or wait. This is not
  a bug. It is the market mechanism that allocates finite block space. Once she understands
  mempool pressure, she stops reading delays as “network broken” and starts treating them as
  normal market signals.
keyTakeaways:
  - Fee rate (sat/vB), not payment amount, drives inclusion priority.
  - Mempools are local policy-governed views, not one global queue.
  - RBF/CPFP are practical tools for stuck transactions.
securityNotes:
  - Congestion increases incentives for replacement abuse against weak 0-conf flows.
  - Fee volatility can alter short-term miner behavior and reorg incentives.

policyVsConsensus:
  consensusRules:
    - Valid transactions can be mined regardless of mempool origin path.
    - Block validity does not require universal mempool agreement.
  policyRules:
    - Min relay fee, eviction logic, and replacement policy are local.
    - Standardness filters can exclude otherwise consensus-valid transactions from relay.
  explanation: Consensus governs mined validity; policy governs pre-confirmation market behavior and visibility.

## Deep Dive
Mempool policy manages admission and replacement for unconfirmed transactions. Miners select from mempool under fee and policy constraints.

**Real Data:** Show `fast/half-hour/hour fee estimates` and `mempool virtual size`. These explain confirmation delays and bumping decisions.

## Walkthrough
1. Transaction arrives at node.
2. Node applies policy and stores/rejects.
3. Miners select high-fee candidates.
4. Congestion changes market-clearing fee.

## Common Misconceptions
- “Low amount means low fee needed.” False.
- “One mempool state exists globally.” False.
- “RBF means protocol weakness.” It is policy behavior.

## Check Yourself (Questions)
- Why is sat/vB the key metric?
- How can CPFP rescue a stuck parent transaction?
- Which layer controls replacement behavior?
