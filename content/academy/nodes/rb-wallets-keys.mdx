summary: Wallets store and protect keys, while coins remain on-chain as spendable UTXOs controlled by scripts.
story: >-
  Alice tells Bob she "keeps bitcoin in her wallet," and Bob imagines digital coins sitting inside an app.
  Then her phone dies, and she restores everything from a seed phrase on a new device. Bob is confused:
  if the coins were in the old phone, how did they return? Carol explains the key idea: wallets do not hold
  coins, they hold secrets that prove spending rights on the blockchain. The UTXOs never left the chain.
  The wallet is a key manager, transaction constructor, and backup interface. Once Bob sees this model,
  common mistakes become obvious: sharing seed phrases, reusing addresses, and trusting custody without
  understanding who controls keys. The phrase "not your keys, not your coins" stops sounding like a slogan
  and starts sounding like an operational rule.
keyTakeaways:
  - Wallets manage private keys and signing, not coin storage.
  - Recovery phrases are key backups, not account passwords.
  - Custody model determines who can authorize spending.
securityNotes:
  - Seed phrase exposure enables full wallet takeover.
  - Hardware isolation and backup hygiene materially reduce key-compromise risk.

policyVsConsensus:
  consensusRules:
    - Only valid signatures and script conditions authorize UTXO spending.
    - Ownership is enforced by consensus validation of witness/script data.
  policyRules:
    - Wallet software chooses derivation paths, coin selection, and UX defaults.
    - Services define withdrawal limits and security workflows as operational policy.
  explanation: Consensus determines whether a spend is valid; wallet policy determines how users generate, protect, and broadcast that spend.

## Deep Dive
A wallet is a key-management and transaction-authoring system. It discovers UTXOs for controlled scripts, selects coins, builds a transaction, and signs with private keys.

### Real Data
Show `new block height`, `recommended fees`, and `address activity` for a selected receive address. This helps learners see that balances are derived from chain state, not stored in the wallet app.

## Walkthrough
1. Generate seed and derive account keys.
2. Derive receive address and monitor matching UTXOs.
3. Build spend transaction from selected inputs.
4. Sign and broadcast through peers.
5. Confirm on-chain and update wallet state.

## Common Misconceptions
- "My bitcoin sits in my phone." The phone holds keys, not coins.
- "A seed phrase is like a password reset email." It is full key material.
- "Custodial and self-custody are equivalent." They are different trust models.

## Check Yourself (Questions)
- What exactly is recovered when restoring a wallet from seed?
- Why does address reuse increase privacy risk?
- Which part is consensus-critical: wallet UI or signature validity?
