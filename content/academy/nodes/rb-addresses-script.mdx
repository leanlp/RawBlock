summary: Addresses are human-friendly encodings of script destinations, not always raw public keys.
story: >-
  Bob copies a Bitcoin address from a customer and asks why some start with “1,” some with
  “3,” and others with “bc1.” Alice explains he is seeing different script destination formats,
  not different currencies. An address is an encoded representation of where spend conditions
  are set. In some cases it references a key hash, in others a script hash, and in modern
  outputs a witness program. Bob had assumed “address equals public key,” but that shortcut
  breaks quickly in real usage. The distinction matters for compatibility, fee efficiency,
  and error prevention. When you treat addresses as script endpoints, wallet behavior and
  upgrade history make much more sense.
keyTakeaways:
  - Address format signals script/witness destination type.
  - Address and public key are related but not identical concepts.
  - Proper encoding and checksum handling prevents costly mistakes.
securityNotes:
  - Wrong format handling can produce send failures or unsafe assumptions.
  - Address reuse increases transaction graph linkage risk.

linkedAssumptions:

policyVsConsensus:
  consensusRules:
    - Spend validation is defined by script/witness rules, not display format.
    - Output type semantics must satisfy active consensus rules.
  policyRules:
    - Wallets/exchanges may restrict accepted destination types.
    - Relay policy can discourage uncommon script templates.
  explanation: Consensus validates script semantics; policy and UI govern accepted address formats and defaults.

## Deep Dive
Addresses wrap script destination data into user-safe strings with checksums. Script type determines spend path and weight implications.

**Real Data:** Show `segwit/taproot adoption share` and `fee recommendations` to explain why format choice impacts real cost.

## Walkthrough
1. Wallet derives destination script.
2. Encodes to address format.
3. Sender constructs output script from decoded destination.
4. Receiver spends under script rules.

## Common Misconceptions
- “Address equals public key.” Not generally.
- “All address types cost the same.” They do not.
- “Format differences are cosmetic.” They encode semantics.

## Check Yourself (Questions)
- What does bech32m add for Taproot destinations?
- Why is checksum quality operationally important?
- Where is actual spend logic enforced: address layer or script layer?
