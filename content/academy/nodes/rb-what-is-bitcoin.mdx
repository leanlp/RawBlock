summary: Bitcoin is a decentralized monetary network where independent nodes verify rules and share one public ledger without central control.
story: >-
  Alice runs a small export shop in Buenos Aires. Her suppliers are in three countries,
  and bank wires take days, sometimes longer, with unpredictable fees. A friend suggests
  she try Bitcoin for settlement. At first she thinks Bitcoin is just an app or a coin
  price chart. But when she opens a block explorer, she sees something different: a global
  ledger updated by many participants who do not trust each other yet still agree on one
  chain of history. No single company can rewrite balances, and no bank clerk can freeze
  a transaction because of office hours. She realizes the real product is not a token but
  a protocol: open rules, verifiable history, and independent validation. That shift in
  perspective matters. If Bitcoin is a protocol, then security comes from rules and
  incentives, not from branding. That is the right starting point for everything else.
keyTakeaways:
  - Bitcoin is a protocol and network, not a company-run database.
  - Full nodes enforce shared validity rules independently.
  - Monetary issuance is constrained by consensus and halving epochs.
securityNotes:
  - Security depends on broad independent validation and robust peer connectivity.
  - Finality is probabilistic; deeper confirmations reduce reversal risk.

policyVsConsensus:
  consensusRules:
    - Valid blocks and transactions must satisfy deterministic consensus checks.
    - New issuance is only allowed through valid coinbase construction and schedule rules.
  policyRules:
    - Nodes may apply relay policies (fees/standardness) without changing global validity.
    - Miners choose transaction template policy while still bound by consensus validity.
  explanation: Consensus defines what can exist on-chain; policy defines what a node relays before confirmation.
caseStudies:
  - title: 2010 Value Overflow Incident
    year: 2010
    whatHappened: A consensus bug allowed invalid inflation in an early block.
    whyItMatters: It demonstrated why strict validation and rapid coordinated patching are essential.
  - title: CVE-2018-17144
    year: 2018
    whatHappened: Duplicate-input validation regression created inflation risk.
    whyItMatters: It reinforced the critical nature of consensus code review and release discipline.

## Deep Dive
Bitcoin combines a public transaction ledger, digital signatures, and proof-of-work chain selection. A full node accepts data only if each rule passes: syntax, signatures, spending constraints, and block validity.

**Real Data:** Show `block height`, `days to halving`, and `network hashrate`. These metrics tell learners where the network is in monetary time and how much work currently protects recent history.

## Walkthrough
1. Wallet creates a transaction proposal.
2. Peers relay it through mempools.
3. A miner includes it in a valid block.
4. Nodes validate and extend best chain by accumulated work.
5. Confirmations increase reversal cost over time.

## Common Misconceptions
- “Miners decide consensus rules.” They do not; nodes enforce rules.
- “Bitcoin is anonymous by default.” It is pseudonymous, with public traceable flows.
- “One confirmation equals absolute finality.” Finality is probabilistic.

## Check Yourself (Questions)
- Why is independent node validation central to Bitcoin’s trust model?
- What is the difference between policy and consensus in one sentence?
- Which live metric best reflects current settlement security posture?
