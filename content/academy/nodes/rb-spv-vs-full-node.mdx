summary: SPV clients verify inclusion proofs but depend on external honesty assumptions; full nodes independently validate all consensus rules.
story: >-
  Bob wants a lightweight mobile wallet for daily use. It syncs quickly and shows balances in seconds.
  Carol asks a simple question: "Who told your wallet those balances are valid?" Bob realizes the app trusts
  external servers for parts of truth it cannot verify locally. Later, he also runs a full node at home and sees
  the trade-off clearly: SPV is faster and lighter, full-node validation is stronger and sovereign. He keeps both:
  mobile convenience for routine spending, full-node verification for high-trust decisions. The point is not that
  one is "good" and the other "bad." The point is understanding exactly which assumptions you accept.
keyTakeaways:
  - Full nodes verify consensus rules directly; SPV verifies less and trusts more.
  - Lightweight verification is practical but has a different security model.
  - Risk-sensitive users should anchor workflows to full-node validation.
securityNotes:
  - SPV clients are more exposed to eclipse and data-source manipulation.
  - Full nodes reduce trust in third-party infrastructure and policy decisions.

policyVsConsensus:
  consensusRules:
    - Consensus is defined by full validation of scripts, signatures, and block rules.
    - Merkle inclusion alone does not prove full transaction validity.
  policyRules:
    - Wallet backends choose peer selection and data-serving behavior.
    - Light client products choose UX and trust defaults.
  explanation: Consensus security comes from complete validation; SPV policy choices trade resource use for additional trust assumptions.

    whatHappened: The whitepaper described simplified payment verification for lightweight use.
    whyItMatters: SPV was always a trade-off model, not equal-security replacement for full validation.

## Deep Dive
Full nodes download and validate complete block/transaction data against consensus rules. SPV-style clients verify less data and rely on assumptions about honest majority work and data availability.

### Real Data
Show `peer count`, `latest block height`, and `header sync status`. These metrics help learners see what local verification depth their client actually has.

## Walkthrough
1. SPV client downloads headers chain.
2. Requests proofs for relevant transactions.
3. Accepts inclusion evidence under chainwork assumptions.
4. Full node independently validates complete ruleset for stronger assurance.

## Common Misconceptions
- "SPV is equivalent to full-node security." It is not.
- "Running a full node means mining." Full-node validation and mining are distinct roles.
- "If a transaction is in a block, it is always valid." Full script/rule checks still matter.

## Check Yourself (Questions)
- What can a full node detect that SPV may miss?
- Why does peer diversity matter more for light clients?
- When is SPV acceptable in practice?
