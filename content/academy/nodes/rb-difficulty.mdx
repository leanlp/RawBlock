summary: Bitcoin retargets difficulty every 2016 blocks to keep long-run block cadence near ten minutes despite hashrate changes.
story: >-
  Carol notices blocks arriving quickly for several days, then slowing down after a mining
  region goes offline. She assumes the system is unstable, but the protocol is doing what
  it was designed to do. Bitcoin does not fix hashrate; it fixes rule-based adjustment.
  Every 2016 blocks, nodes compare expected elapsed time to observed elapsed time and update
  target difficulty accordingly. If hashrate rises, target tightens. If hashrate falls,
  target loosens. This keeps issuance and confirmation tempo anchored over long windows,
  even through real-world shocks. Carol now understands why short-term delays do not imply
  failure and why retarget boundaries are key operational checkpoints for miners and users.
  Difficulty is the network’s timing governor, not a market prediction engine.
keyTakeaways:
  - Difficulty retarget is consensus logic, not operator preference.
  - Short-term block timing can drift between retarget windows.
  - Long-run cadence stability is preserved through deterministic adjustment.
securityNotes:
  - Timestamp manipulation attempts are studied because they affect retarget inputs.
  - Difficulty alone does not stop attacks; it scales work requirements.

policyVsConsensus:
  consensusRules:
    - New target is computed at fixed retarget interval under consensus formula.
    - Headers must satisfy current target to be valid.
  policyRules:
    - Monitoring and alerting around abnormal intervals are operational policy choices.
    - Mining pool strategy may react to retarget expectations.
  explanation: Consensus defines retarget math; policy governs how operators respond to timing anomalies.

## Deep Dive
Difficulty target is encoded in header nBits and recalculated on schedule. This keeps long-run issuance cadence stable despite volatile global hashpower.

**Real Data:** Show `current hashrate`, `last retarget change`, and `blocks to next retarget`. These metrics help learners see timing control in action.

## Walkthrough
1. Measure elapsed time over prior epoch.
2. Compute adjusted target under consensus limits.
3. Encode target in nBits.
4. Validate future blocks against new target.

## Common Misconceptions
- “Difficulty means miners solve harder math problems.” It is target threshold adjustment.
- “Retarget instantly fixes slow blocks.” It updates at epoch boundaries.
- “Difficulty is the same as hashrate.” Related, not identical.

## Check Yourself (Questions)
- Why can blocks be slow right after a major hashrate drop?
- Which field in header represents target encoding?
- Is retarget logic policy or consensus?
