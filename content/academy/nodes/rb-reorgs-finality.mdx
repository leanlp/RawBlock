summary: Bitcoin finality is probabilistic; reorg risk falls as cumulative proof-of-work and confirmations increase.
story: >-
  Bob ships high-value electronics and accepts Bitcoin payments. One morning he sees a transaction with one
  confirmation and wants to release inventory immediately. Carol stops him: "One confirmation is better than
  zero, but not the same as final settlement for this risk size." She explains that short chain reorganizations
  can happen naturally from block race conditions, and adversarial reorg attempts become harder with each added
  block. Bob creates a confirmation policy by amount tier: low-value orders can move faster, large transfers wait
  deeper. Later, during a volatile fee period, that policy prevents a costly mistake. He learns finality on Bitcoin
  is not binary; it is a risk function tied to depth, hashpower environment, and business tolerance.
keyTakeaways:
  - Reorgs are possible; confirmation depth reduces reversal probability.
  - Finality policy should match value-at-risk and threat model.
  - Network propagation quality affects short-range fork behavior.
securityNotes:
  - Accepting zero or shallow confirmations raises reversal risk.
  - Monitoring competing tips and unusual stale patterns improves operational safety.

policyVsConsensus:
  consensusRules:
    - Nodes follow the valid chain with the most accumulated proof-of-work.
    - Invalid blocks are rejected regardless of competing chain length.
  policyRules:
    - Businesses choose confirmation thresholds per risk policy.
    - Exchanges and merchants define deposit crediting delays operationally.
  explanation: Consensus provides chain selection rules; policy sets how much depth an application demands before considering settlement final enough.

    year: 2013
    whatHappened: Competing near-simultaneous blocks occasionally caused 1-block reorgs.
    whyItMatters: Reorgs are a normal statistical property, not always an attack.

    whyItMatters: Operational coordination and conservative upgrade strategy are critical.

## Deep Dive
A reorg occurs when a node switches to another valid branch with higher accumulated work. Most reorgs are shallow; deep adversarial reorgs require substantial sustained hashpower.

### Real Data
Show `recent stale/orphan indicators`, `network hashrate`, and `current fee pressure`. These metrics help learners reason about near-term confirmation risk.

## Walkthrough
1. Two miners find competing blocks near the same time.
2. Different peers see different tips briefly.
3. One branch gains additional work and becomes best chain.
4. Transactions from the losing block return to mempool if still valid.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Six confirmations is a protocol guarantee." It is a common policy heuristic.
- "Any reorg means attack." Many are natural race conditions.
- "One confirmation is final for all use cases." Risk tolerance varies by amount.

## Check Yourself (Questions)
- What distinguishes consensus finality from business finality policy?
- Why can fast propagation reduce reorg frequency?
- Which attack models become easier if a node is eclipsed?
