summary: Bitcoin transactions consume prior outputs and create new outputs, then move through relay, mempool, mining, and confirmation stages.
story: >-
  Bob receives payment for a design contract and checks his wallet. It says “unconfirmed,”
  and he is unsure whether the money is final. Minutes later, fee rates spike and his
  transaction remains pending. He learns a hard truth: a transaction is not one moment,
  it is a lifecycle. First it is constructed and signed. Then peers relay it. Then miners
  choose whether to include it based on fee pressure and policy. Only after block inclusion
  does it begin accumulating confirmations. Bob also discovers fee bumping and replacement
  policy matter in practice. A transaction can be valid yet delayed, or seen by one node
  earlier than another. Understanding this lifecycle turns wallet notifications into
  meaningful risk signals instead of guesswork. That mindset is essential for merchants,
  exchanges, and anyone handling time-sensitive settlement.
keyTakeaways:
  - Mempool presence is not final settlement.
  - Fee rate strongly affects inclusion speed in congestion.
  - Confirmation depth is a practical risk-control parameter.
securityNotes:
  - Zero-confirmation acceptance is exposed to double-spend patterns.
  - Policy differences across nodes can change propagation and replacement behavior.

policyVsConsensus:
  consensusRules:
    - Inputs must reference valid unspent outputs and satisfy locking conditions.
    - Transaction format and signatures must pass deterministic verification.
  policyRules:
    - Relay may reject low-fee or non-standard transactions.
    - RBF acceptance follows local policy and mempool replacement logic.
  explanation: Consensus says whether a transaction is valid on-chain; policy decides whether it is relayed before mining.
caseStudies:

    year: 2014
    whatHappened: Txid mutation created tracking and accounting failures in unconfirmed workflows.
    whyItMatters: It motivated SegWit architecture and better transaction state handling.

    whatHappened: Some services accepted unconfirmed payments without replacement monitoring.
    whyItMatters: Operational policy must match protocol reality under fee pressure.

## Deep Dive
A transaction has inputs, outputs, lock conditions, and signatures. Nodes validate structure and scripts, then decide relay under local policy. Miners prioritize by fee density and template constraints.

**Real Data:** Show `recommended fees` (fast/half-hour/hour) and `mempool size`. This explains why one valid transaction confirms quickly while another waits.

## Walkthrough
1. Wallet selects UTXOs and computes fee.
2. Transaction is signed and broadcast.
3. Peers validate and relay to mempool.
4. Miner includes tx in candidate block.
5. Tx confirms and gains depth.

## Common Misconceptions
- “If my wallet broadcast it, it is final.” False.
- “RBF is a bug.” No, it is policy behavior.
- “All nodes have identical mempool contents.” Not always.

## Check Yourself (Questions)
- Which part is consensus and which part is policy in transaction relay?
- Why can two valid transactions have very different confirmation times?
- What risk remains after one confirmation?
