summary: Mining orders transactions through proof-of-work and earns coinbase payout composed of subsidy plus fees.
story: >-
  Alice watches two dashboards: customer payments and electricity prices. Her team runs a
  small mining operation, and profit can flip quickly when fees drop or power costs rise.
  She explains to Bob that miners are not “printing coins whenever they want.” They compete
  to find valid blocks, and nodes reject invalid work instantly. Revenue comes from two
  parts: protocol subsidy and transaction fees. Over time, subsidy halves while fee market
  importance grows. This matters for everyone, not just miners. If block space is scarce,
  users feel it through confirmation delays and higher fees. Mining is where cryptography,
  energy cost, and market incentives meet. Once you understand miner economics, many security
  ideas become clearer: why deep reorgs are expensive, why centralization risk matters, and
  why confirmation policies should scale with value-at-risk.
keyTakeaways:
  - Coinbase payout equals subsidy plus included transaction fees.
  - Proof-of-work makes historical rewrite economically costly.
  - Hashrate distribution affects censorship and reorg risk.
securityNotes:
  - Concentrated hashpower weakens censorship resistance assumptions.
  - Fee spikes can create short-term incentive distortions (e.g., fee sniping pressure).

policyVsConsensus:
  consensusRules:
    - Block must satisfy target and include valid coinbase payout limits.
    - Invalid blocks are rejected regardless of miner identity.
  policyRules:
    - Transaction selection and ordering in templates are miner policy choices.
    - Relay policy influences transaction visibility to miners.
  explanation: Consensus constrains validity; policy determines which valid transactions miners prioritize.

## Deep Dive
Mining is a repeated hash search over candidate headers. The successful miner earns a coinbase payout if and only if the block is consensus-valid and accepted by nodes.

**Real Data:** Show `network hashrate`, `blocks until halving`, and `fee-rate distribution`. These reveal security budget conditions and changing miner revenue mix.

## Walkthrough
1. Build candidate template from mempool.
2. Iterate nonce/extra nonce for target hit.
3. Broadcast found block.
4. Nodes validate and accept/reject.
5. Coinbase payout matures after required depth.

## Common Misconceptions
- “Miners control consensus rules.” Full nodes do.
- “Subsidy equals total miner revenue forever.” Fees matter increasingly.
- “High hashrate means zero risk.” It means higher cost, not zero risk.

## Check Yourself (Questions)
- What are the two components of miner payout?
- Why can an invalid high-work block still be rejected?
- Which live metric indicates approaching subsidy epoch changes?
