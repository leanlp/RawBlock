summary: Bitcoin changes through conservative soft forks and open BIP processes, preserving backward compatibility for non-upgraded nodes.
story: >-
  Alice hears that Bitcoin "never changes," then sees people discussing upgrades like SegWit and Taproot.
  Bob assumes that means a central team pushes updates at will. Carol walks them through what really happens:
  proposals are written as BIPs, debated publicly, implemented cautiously, and activated only when ecosystem
  support is broad enough to avoid unsafe splits. The process is often slow and sometimes frustrating, but that
  slowness is part of the security model. Changes that affect consensus must be legible, reviewable, and socially
  coordinated across independent actors. Alice realizes governance in Bitcoin is not voting in an app; it is
  decentralized rough consensus backed by code, incentives, and careful rollout.
keyTakeaways:
  - BIPs are specification artifacts, not commands from an authority.
  - Soft forks tighten validity rules while preserving compatibility assumptions.
  - Activation design is a security and coordination problem, not just coding.
securityNotes:
  - Unsafe activation strategy can create chain split risk.
  - Consensus code changes require extraordinary review discipline.

policyVsConsensus:
  consensusRules:
    - Soft-fork rules become consensus only after activation conditions are met.
    - Non-compliant blocks/transactions are invalid post-activation.
  policyRules:
    - Nodes and services choose software versions and deployment timing.
    - Relay defaults and standardness can evolve without direct consensus changes.
  explanation: Consensus change requires broad, careful activation; many day-to-day behaviors remain policy-level and locally chosen.
caseStudies:
  - title: SegWit Activation (BIP 141)
    year: 2017
    whatHappened: SegWit activated as a soft fork after extensive ecosystem coordination.
    whyItMatters: Demonstrated compatibility-preserving consensus upgrade in production.
  - title: Taproot Activation (BIP 341/342)
    year: 2021
    whatHappened: Taproot deployed through modern activation and broad review.
    whyItMatters: Showed continued conservative upgrade path for Bitcoin.

## Deep Dive
A soft fork introduces stricter consensus validity conditions while legacy nodes may continue operating without fully understanding new script forms. BIPs document rationale, specification, and deployment details.

### Real Data
Show `versionbits signaling`, `Taproot/SegWit adoption`, and `current node version distribution`. This helps learners connect governance mechanics to observed network rollout behavior.

## Walkthrough
1. Proposal drafted as BIP.
2. Public review and implementation in clients.
3. Activation parameters and signaling monitored.
4. Rule activates and nodes enforce new validity constraints.

## Common Misconceptions
- "BIPs are laws." They are proposals/specifications.
- "Bitcoin never upgrades." It upgrades conservatively.
- "Policy and consensus updates are the same thing." They are not.

## Check Yourself (Questions)
- What makes a change a soft fork rather than a hard fork?
- Why is activation design a security concern?
- How can users verify which rules their node enforces?
