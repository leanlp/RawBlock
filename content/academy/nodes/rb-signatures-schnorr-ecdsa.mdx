summary: Bitcoin uses digital signatures to authorize spending; ECDSA remains valid while Schnorr enables newer Taproot capabilities.
story: >-
  Carol runs an operations desk where multiple approvals are required for treasury movements. In the early setup,
  multisig transactions were larger and more revealing on-chain than she liked. After learning Taproot, she sees
  that cooperative participants can use Schnorr-based key-path spending with better efficiency and cleaner on-chain
  footprints. But she also keeps legacy compatibility in mind: ECDSA still secures vast existing outputs, and both
  schemes coexist under consensus rules. Her team updates signing policy carefully, tests hardware compatibility,
  and audits every recovery path. The lesson is not "new cryptography is automatically safer." The lesson is that
  signature systems are security-critical interfaces between keys and consensus validity, and migration must be
  deliberate.
keyTakeaways:
  - Digital signatures prove spend authorization without revealing private keys.
  - ECDSA and Schnorr coexist in Bitcoin under defined script contexts.
  - Taproot key-path spending benefits from Schnorr properties.
securityNotes:
  - Poor nonce generation or key leakage can irreversibly compromise funds.
  - Implementation errors in signing stacks are high-impact even if consensus rules are correct.

policyVsConsensus:
  consensusRules:
    - Signature verification semantics are enforced by script/witness consensus rules.
    - Taproot spends must satisfy BIP 340/341/342 validation requirements.
  policyRules:
    - Wallet policy selects which script type and signature path to use by default.
    - Hardware/software signing flows add operational checks beyond consensus.
  explanation: Consensus decides if a signature is valid on-chain; policy decides how and when signatures are produced in practice.

## Deep Dive
Signatures bind a transaction digest to a private key so nodes can verify authorization. Legacy paths use ECDSA; Taproot key-path spends use Schnorr semantics.

### Real Data
Show `Taproot usage share` and `transaction fee range`. This helps explain where Schnorr-enabled spending is appearing in real network traffic.

## Walkthrough
1. Wallet constructs signing preimage for each input context.
2. Signer generates signature with private key.
3. Transaction includes witness/script data.
4. Nodes verify signatures during validation.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Schnorr replaced all Bitcoin signatures." Legacy ECDSA remains widely used.
- "A signature encrypts transaction data." It proves authorization; it does not encrypt the chain.
- "Cryptography removes operational risk." Poor key handling still breaks security.

## Check Yourself (Questions)
- Why can valid signatures exist under different script eras?
- What changed for Taproot key-path spends versus legacy multisig patterns?
- Which failures are protocol-level vs implementation-level?
