summary: Bitcoin security emerges from consensus correctness, economic incentives, network assumptions, and disciplined operations.
story: >-
  Alice asks her team to run a tabletop incident drill: a sudden fee spike, a short reorg,
  and rumors of mining concentration. No single metric answers everything. The right approach
  is layered. First, verify consensus safety: are blocks valid? Next, inspect network health:
  is propagation delayed or partitioned? Then evaluate incentives: does current market pressure
  create unusual miner behavior? Finally, check operational controls: confirmation policy,
  key hygiene, and monitoring quality. Bob realizes that “Bitcoin is secure” is not a magic
  statement; it is an ongoing process of assumptions and evidence. Security work means mapping
  threats to layers and responding proportionally. That is why Raw Block links vulnerabilities,
  attack models, assumptions, and policy-vs-consensus analysis in one workflow.
keyTakeaways:
  - Security is layered: consensus, network, economics, operations.
  - Attack feasibility depends on capability, cost, and detection.
  - Confirmation and custody policies must match risk levels.
securityNotes:
  - Separate protocol bugs from abuse patterns and operator misconfiguration.
  - Use explicit escalation criteria for reorg depth and chain anomalies.

policyVsConsensus:
  consensusRules:
    - Consensus bugs can create systemic inflation or chain divergence risk.
    - Consensus-valid history is selected by accumulated proof-of-work.
  policyRules:
    - Relay and fee policies shape pre-confirmation risk surface.
    - Operational confirmation thresholds are security policy decisions.
  explanation: Security incidents must be mapped to layer: consensus failures are systemic; policy failures are often local but still operationally dangerous.

## Deep Dive
Security analysis in Bitcoin requires layer separation: consensus correctness, network resilience, economic incentive compatibility, and key-management operations.

**Real Data:** Show `hashrate`, `fee regime`, and `recent reorg depth`. Together they provide a practical risk context for confirmation and settlement decisions.

## Walkthrough
1. Detect anomaly (fee spike/reorg/relay lag).
2. Classify by layer (consensus, policy, network, economic).
3. Validate chain state and peer health.
4. Apply operational controls (confirmations, monitoring, fail-safe routing).

## Common Misconceptions
- “Any attack mention means Bitcoin failed.” Not true.
- “Policy issues are harmless.” They can be costly operationally.
- “Security is one metric.” It is multi-factor and dynamic.

## Check Yourself (Questions)
- Which incident type is systemic by definition?
- Why does fee regime matter for operational security?
- What assumptions are you implicitly making when accepting 0-conf?
