summary: Blocks package validated transactions, while headers provide cryptographic commitments linking history into a tamper-evident chain.
story: >-
  A new node comes online and receives thousands of data messages. It cannot trust any
  sender, so it starts with structure. Each block header points to a previous block hash,
  commits to a merkle root, and proves enough work for the current target. This compact
  metadata acts like a chain of receipts: change one historical detail and future hashes
  no longer match. Dave, a developer on Alice’s team, initially thought blocks were just
  containers. Then he saw that headers are the security spine. Transactions matter, but
  headers make history auditable at scale. He also learned short stale races can happen
  naturally during propagation, which is why “latest” may briefly differ across peers.
  Understanding block anatomy turns explorer screens into meaningful protocol diagnostics.
keyTakeaways:
  - Headers commit to ancestry and transaction set metadata.
  - Merkle roots make transaction tampering detectable.
  - Chain selection follows accumulated work, not simple count.
securityNotes:
  - Deep unexpected reorgs are high-priority operational signals.
  - Header validation is fast, but full transaction validation remains mandatory.

policyVsConsensus:
  consensusRules:
    - Header hash must satisfy target encoded by nBits.
    - Block must reference valid previous block and pass transaction checks.
  policyRules:
    - Node relay and orphan handling can differ without altering consensus validity.
    - Propagation optimization policies affect local view timing.
  explanation: Consensus defines valid blocks; policy affects how quickly and from whom nodes receive candidate data.

## Deep Dive
A block contains transactions and a header. The header includes version, previous block hash, merkle root, timestamp, nBits, and nonce. Nodes verify both header and full transaction set.

**Real Data:** Show `latest block height`, `average block interval`, and `recent stale/reorg count`. This helps learners connect structure to real operational behavior.

## Walkthrough
1. Miner builds candidate block.
2. Miner finds valid nonce for target.
3. Block propagates to peers.
4. Nodes validate header and transactions.
5. Chainwork comparison chooses best tip.

## Common Misconceptions
- “A longer chain by block count always wins.” Chainwork wins.
- “Header validation is enough for security.” Full validation is still required.
- “Any reorg means attack.” Short reorgs can be normal.

## Check Yourself (Questions)
- Which header field commits transaction set integrity?
- Why can two honest nodes briefly disagree on tip?
- What metric tells you whether a block is economically expensive to replace?
