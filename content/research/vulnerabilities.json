    "category": "consensus-validation",
    "severity": "critical",
    "year": 2018,
    "summary": "A regression in duplicate-input checks created a potential inflation and denial-of-service risk.",
    "details": "Certain Bitcoin Core versions could accept transactions with duplicate inputs in a way that threatened consensus safety. If exploited in a mined block, this could have created invalid inflation or destabilized node behavior.",
    "impact": "Potential inflation and consensus instability if exploited on chain.",
    "mitigations": [
      "Upgrade to patched Bitcoin Core releases (0.16.3+).",
      "Maintain conservative node upgrade and review procedures.",
      "Use defense-in-depth testing for transaction validation paths."

    "severity": "high",
    "year": 2014,
    "summary": "Before SegWit, txid-sensitive workflows were vulnerable to third-party transaction ID mutation.",
    "details": "Legacy transaction serialization allowed mutations in signature-related fields that changed txid without changing economic intent. This complicated unconfirmed tracking and protocol overlays dependent on txid stability.",
    "impact": "Operational failures, accounting confusion, and higher complexity for second-layer protocol design.",
    "mitigations": [
      "Adopt SegWit transaction formats.",
      "Use wtxid-aware tooling and robust confirmation logic.",
