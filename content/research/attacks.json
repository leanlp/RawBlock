    "details": "By controlling inbound and outbound peers around a target node, an attacker can delay block/transaction visibility and influence decisions that depend on timely propagation.",
    "impact": "Increased reorg risk perception, degraded node reliability, and easier setup for other attack classes.",

      "Diversify peers and connection paths.",
      "Use modern Bitcoin Core networking protections and updates.",
