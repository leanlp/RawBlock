# UI/UX Visual Audit Report: Rawblock.net
**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Auditor**: Antigravity (Senior UI/UX Tester)
**Target**: `www.rawblock.net`

## Executive Summary
The visual audit reveals a polished, "Dark Mode" aesthetic that generally responds well to different viewports. However, a critical usability defect (missing Copy buttons) and some layout inefficiencies on very large screens were identified.

## 1. Responsiveness Audit

### Mobile (375px)
**Status**: **Mixed (Mostly Good)**
- **✅ Navigation**: Hamburger menu works correctly; sidebar collapses effectively.
- **✅ Data Tables**: "Latest Blocks" and "Rich List" automatically use horizontal scrolling (`overflow-x-auto`), preventing site breakage.
- **✅ Truncation**: Long hashes (e.g., `0000...28ca`) are truncated appropriately.
- **⚠️ Issues**:
    - **Header Stacking**: On Block Details, the full block hash wraps to 3 lines, creating a very tall header that pushes primary content below the fold.
    - **Dense Decoder**: The "Butterfly Layout" stacks vertically (Inputs on top, Outputs on bottom). While functional, the distinction between the two sections is less visually distinct than on desktop.

### Desktop (1920px)
**Status**: **Functional but Sparse**
- **✅ Scaling**: The "Block DNA" Treemap scales beautifully without pixelation and tooltips are readable.
- **⚠️ White Space**: The "Latest Blocks" table stretches to the full 1920px width, leaving excessive whitespace between columns (Miner -> Time), making it hard to scan rows horizontally.
- **⚠️ Butterfly Gaps**: In the Transaction Decoder, the gap between Input and Output columns is very wide, disconnecting the visual "flow" of funds.

## 2. Interactive Elements Audit
**Status**: **FAIL**
- **❌ Copy Buttons**: The audit explicitly checked for "Copy to Clipboard" buttons next to:
    - Transaction Hashes (TXIDs)
    - Block Hashes
    - Addresses
  **Result**: **NONE FOUND**. Users must manually select text to copy it. This is a critical usability miss for a blockchain explorer.

## 3. Data Visualization
**Status**: **Pass with Notes**
- **✅ Treemap**: Tooltips work perfectly on hover. Colors (SegWit vs Legacy) are distinct.
- **❌ Missing Sparklines**: The request mentioned checking Hashrate/Difficulty graphs/sparklines. These appear to be static numbers rather than interactive charts.

## Recommendations
1.  **Urgent**: Implement "Click-to-Copy" icons next to all Hashes and Addresses.
2.  **Layout**: Set a `max-width` (e.g., `1440px`) for the main container on purely tabular pages to prevent "stretched" tables on ultra-wide monitors.
3.  **Mobile Tuning**: Truncate the Block Hash in the **Title** of the Block Details page on mobile to 1 line with an ellipsis, rather than wrapping it to 3 lines.

## Conclusion
Visually stable, but lacks key interactive "quality of life" features expected in 2026.
